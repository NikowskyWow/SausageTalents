# 🌭 Sausage Talents (WotLK 3.3.5a)

**Sausage Talents** is a premium profile manager designed for **World of Warcraft 3.3.5a**. It allows you to save, load, and share complete builds (Talents + Action Bars) between characters and realms instantly.

* **Version**: v1.1.0
* **WoW**: 3.3.5a
* **Author**: Sausage Party

## ✨ Features

* **Unified Profiles:** Saves your **Talent Tree** allocation and **Action Bar** layout into a single preset.
* **Cross-Realm & Cross-Character:** Seamlessly import profiles from other characters on different realms (e.g., from Onyxia to Blackrock).
* **Smart Talent Learning:** Automatically calculates missing points and learns them instantly.
* **Conflict Protection:** Checks if your current talents conflict with the saved profile.
* **Modern UI:**
    * Dark, themed interface matching the "Sausage" design suite.
    * **Class Validation:** Prevents loading incompatible profiles.
    * **Live Progress Bar:** Visual feedback during profile application.
    * **Safety Features:** Confirmation dialog before deleting profiles.

## ⚠️ Important Note About Talents

The addon **cannot unlearn talents** for you. In WotLK, talent points are permanent until you visit a Class Trainer.

* If you have **conflicting talents** (e.g., you have 5 points in *Divine Strength* but the profile requires 0), the addon will stop and show an error message.
* **Solution:** Visit a Class Trainer, reset your talents, and then apply the profile again.
